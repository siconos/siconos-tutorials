- Tested with `Siconos 4.4.0` on Ubuntu 18.04

- Launch the simulations corresponding to an example using: 

   ``siconos example_1.cpp ``

for example 1. Do similarly for example 2 and 3.

- Simulations results are outputed in a corresponding `.dat` file. These files are plotted using the jupyter-notebook `plot_results.ipynb`.
